Example Output
```

Step 1.  Explore the API
1. What version of the API does this project build with?
2. What access aspects are defined in this version? [Hint](http://alcshare.com/contentprotector/files/sdk/ver1.0.8/javadoc/index.html)

Step 2. Modify NamedFloatValueAcceptor
If you modify the NamedFloatValueAcceptor to accept SetpointAdjust instead of PresentValue, what happens when you run?
Where else do you have to change the code in order to build and deploy the addon?
